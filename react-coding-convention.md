## 1. Basic Rules

General principles for writing clean, maintainable, and readable React code — including syntax best practices and coding discipline.

---

## 2. Naming

Standards for naming variables, functions, components, hooks, and files to maintain clarity and consistency across the codebase

---

## 3. Component Declaration

Guidelines on declaring React components (functional over class), including structure, naming, and prop typing.

---

## 4. Hooks

Best practices for using built-in and custom hooks, emphasizing reusability, clarity, and correct lifecycle usage.

---

## 5. Code Formatting

Rules around how the code should be formatted (line breaks, alignment, indentation style), typically enforced by Prettier or linters.

---

## 6. Quotes

Quote usage rules — prefer single (') or double (") quotes consistently across JavaScript, JSX, and HTML attributes.

---

## 7. Spacing & Indentation

Rules for indentation (e.g., 2 spaces), spacing between code blocks, JSX props, brackets, etc., to improve code readability.

---

## 8. Props

How to pass, destructure, and organize props in components for clarity and predictability, including rules around ordering and typing.

---

## 9. Refs

Best practices for using ref in components, with emphasis on readability and avoiding misuse.
---

## 10. JSX Formatting

Rules around writing clean and readable JSX, including line breaks, multiline attributes, self-closing tags, and wrapping logic in JSX.

---

## 11. Methods

Guidelines for naming and organizing functions/methods inside components, especially event handlers or custom logic blocks.

---

## 12. Code Ordering

Define the standard order of writing code blocks inside a file for better readability and team familiarity.

### 12.1. Import Order

Establishes a consistent order of import statements: standard libraries, third-party modules, internal components, relative imports, styles.

### 12.2. Component Method Order

Preferred order of methods within components (e.g., state, lifecycle, handlers, render), especially for class components or complex hooks.

---

## 13. Third-Party Package

Guidelines on how and when to use third-party packages, ensuring reliability, consistency, and codebase maintainability.

---

## 14. Folder & File structure

Defines how to structure features, components, and utilities in folders — either domain-based or atomic design pattern.

---

## 15. State Management

Clarifies when to use local state (useState), shared state (Context), or global state (Redux, Zustand), and patterns for organizing state logic.

---

## 16. Error Handling

Best practices for handling errors in API calls, UI rendering, and component boundaries using try/catch, fallback UIs, or error boundaries.

---

## 17. Testing

Guidelines for writing and organizing tests using libraries like Jest or React Testing Library. Covers unit, integration, and component testing.
